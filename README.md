# Find Luigi
Fun little NON PROFIT FAN game in which I emulate the mini game from new super mario for the DS 

## Tech Stack
- GD script


## How to Run
- There is an exe file you can click and play

## How to play?
- Easy just look for luigi like its wheres waldo
- As you continue to find him the time to find him shrinks and more heads get added to make it harder for you 
- Meant to be played in the background as you diligently pay attention during your meetings and calls.
